# Bake It Til You Make It
As someone who struggles with cooking, especially around the holidays, I want a site that will help me select a dish appropriate for the holiday at the corresponding time of the year. I want something that will give me a variety of recipe options and their links to my selected holiday. It would also be incredibly helpful if this site could tell me which holidays are coming up, that way I may plan ahead and avoid the holiday rush at the grocery store. I would like the option to click the holiday from a list and see its corresponding recipes or search for it in a search bar and be shown the same results. Finally, if I have any certain recipes I like, I would love to be able to bookmark them for later use.
